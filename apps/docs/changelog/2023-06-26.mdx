Yesterday Davi asked us on twitter about his requirement to limit access to his api.
<Card>

  The id of the user
Hey [@james_r_perkins](https://twitter.com/james_r_perkins) are we going to have single use keys on unkey?

The idea is for other companies using my api's. If they want some data from me, they need a new key before every request

What do you think of it?

## - Added the `ownerId` filter


 If provided, this will only return keys where the `ownerId` matches.


```sh
curl \
  --url https://api.unkey.dev/v1/apis/api_123/keys?ownerId=chronark \
  --header 'Authorization: Bearer <UNKEY>'
```
